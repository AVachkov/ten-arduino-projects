## Materials Needed

All components required for each project are included in the corresponding Tinkercad circuit.  
Simply open the project link in the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) to see the components and wiring for each project.

## Project Overview

Each project includes:

- Arduino code (`.ino` files) 

These projects cover: LEDs, buttons, sensors, buzzers, and other beginner electronics components.

## Getting Started

1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Complete the circuit using my schematics. 
3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.  
4. Open the project `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.  
5. Select the correct board and port under **Tools > Board** and **Tools > Port**.  
6. Click **Upload** to run the project.
